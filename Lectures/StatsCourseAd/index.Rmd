              geom_point(shape = 21, color = "gray30", alpha = I(0.05)) +
              stat_smooth() +
              scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 21, 51, 85))) +

# But remember

The course isn't about math or programming, it is about using these tools to:

- find answers and 

- share what we learn with others.
