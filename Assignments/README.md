# Assignments Overview #

The purpose of the assignments in this course have two purposes

> Give you practice *using* and *exploring* **R**/**RStudio** with new and largely unstructured tasks.

For each assignment I will give you an *objective*, some goal that you will try to accomplish. To achieve this goal I *will not* give you step-by-step instructions. Instead you will need to *rely on the resources* I've made available to you, including:

- lecture material,

- the course [wiki](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_Yonsei/wiki),

- the course texts,

- me (you can ask me questions),

- [Google](http://google.com) and other general web-based resources like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r). 

    - If you have a difficult problem, someone else has probably already had the same issue, asked it on a site like StackOverflow, and received an answer.

 By searching for resources to complete the activities you will hopefully develop *good problem-solving habits* that will help you accomplish future goals you cannot anticipate now.
 
 Also, by not having the answers handed to you, you will develop a *deeper familiarity* with **R**/**RStudio**.
