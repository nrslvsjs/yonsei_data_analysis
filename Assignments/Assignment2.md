**Describe** at least **3** variables in a data set.

You need to select a **range of descriptive statistical tools**. The tools should include both **numerical descriptive statistics** and **graphics**. 

These tools should describe the variables':

- central tendency, 

- variation,

- their relationships with the other variables.

The descriptions need to be discussed **in paragraph form**.

The description must be **reproducible**. So you should email me the link to a Dropbox folder with:

- the `.csv` data set,

- the `.Rmd` R markdown file,

- the final `.html` file.
