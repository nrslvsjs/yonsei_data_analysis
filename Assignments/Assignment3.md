# Assignment 3
### Intro to Social Science Data Analysis 
#### Yonsei University

**Due:** Friday 16 November

---

Have a data set with three variables of the following type:

- 1 numeric continuous variable,

- 1 dummy variable,

- 1 multinomial variable.

There should be more than 50 observations per variable & variable category.

Find the answers to the following questions:

### Numeric Continuous Variable

- What do you predict the population mean of this variable is? 

- Create two groups of this variable based on the dummy variable. Are the population means of these two groups likely to be different? (extra points if you can show this graphically)

### Categorical Variables

- Do the two groups of the dummy variable have values on the multinomial variable that are independent of one another?


---
## Always remember: 

- make your answers reproducible

- show a range of likely values when possible.
